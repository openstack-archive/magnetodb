PutItem
=======

.. automodule:: magnetodb.api.openstack.v1.put_item
   :members:

.. http:post:: v1/data/{project_id}/tables/{table_name}/put_item

-----------
Description
-----------

Adds or rewrites existing item in table. If item already exists and it is just replaced if no other option is
specified. It also supports conditions what are applied before inserting/updating item. If condition passes the item
is updated or inserted.

Conditions support
``````````````````

You can define list of conditions what should be checked before applying insert or update. You can evaluate if specific
item attribute value is equal to given in request or check its existing.

.. literalinclude:: ../api/openstack/samples/condition_exist_equal_sample.json
   :language: javascript

Also you can check if item with given primary key exists in table at all. To do it, you have to build condition if
hash key exists. Technically the items is queried by hash and range key (if range key is defined) and after that
condition is  applied, so adding range key to condition is useless and ValidationError will be rose.
